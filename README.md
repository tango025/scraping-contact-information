# scraping-contact-information
Scapes the email and conatct information from a perticular URL.It uses npm cors-anywhere package as its much more reliable than the easily available cors proxies which send requests from client side.

## Steps to get the server started
```
unzip scraping-contact-information-master.zip   // unzip the downloaded zip package
cd scraping-contact-information-master          // change the directory to the unzipped folder
npm install                                     // to install the dependecies 
npm start                                       // get the server running
```
Once you get the server running edit the URL in the *scraping.html* and run the file.
You can find the information in the developer console.
